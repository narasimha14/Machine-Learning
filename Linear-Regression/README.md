#Linear Regression

This set of code contains implementations of Linear Regression that includes cost and gradient descent computation for single and multi variables.

Below is the description of each file in this repository.

**ex1.m** - Octave/MATLAB driver script that steps you through the linear regression for one variable
**ex1 multi.m** - Octave/MATLAB driver script that steps you through the linear regression for multiple variables
**ex1data1.txt** - Dataset for linear regression with one variable
**ex1data2.txt** - Dataset for linear regression with multiple variables

**plotData.m** - Function to display the dataset
**computeCost.m** - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
**gradientDescent.m** - Function to run gradient descent
**computeCostMulti.m** - Cost function for multiple variables
**gradientDescentMulti.m** - Gradient descent for multiple variables
**featureNormalize.m** - Function to normalize features
**normalEqn.m** - Function to compute the normal equations
